The GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the GNU General Public License (GPL) are both widely used software licenses created by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to protect the rights of users and developers of free and open-source software (FOSS).

# GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)

LGPL allows you to use and distribute the open source software with your application **without releasing the source of your application**.

##### Scope of the license

The LGPL is also a copyleft license, but with a more permissive approach. It allows for linking LGPL-licensed code with non-GPL-licensed code or proprietary software, enabling greater flexibility.

##### Dynamic linking

If a program is dynamically linked with an LGPL-licensed library, the program can be distributed under different terms (including proprietary) **as long as the users have the freedom to replace the library with a modified version**. Meaning, it must contain the `.dll` in a way that the user can change them.

##### Code modifications

Similarly, the LGPL also requires modifications to be shared, but only if the modified library is distributed. Applications linked with the library do not have to disclose their source code if they are not distributed.

##### License propagation

The LGPL allows for the use of LGPL-licensed code in larger works without forcing the entire work to be governed by the LGPL.

# GNU General Public License (GPL)

GPL requires you to **release the source code of your application** if you choose to use and distribute GPL licensed open source software with your application. In other words, your application must also be licensed under GPL.

##### Scope of the license

The GPL is a copyleft license that requires any derivative work or software linked with GPL-licensed code to also be distributed under the GPL.

##### Dynamic linking

 If a program is linked with a GPL-licensed library (statically or dynamically), the entire program must be distributed under the terms of the GPL.

 ##### Code modifications

 When modifying and distributing GPL-licensed software, the source code of the modifications must be made available to recipients under the terms of the GPL.

 ##### License progagation

 If GPL-licensed code is incorporated into a larger work, the entire work must be distributed under the terms of the GPL.
