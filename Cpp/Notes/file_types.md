# Static vs Dynamic libraries

When creating a class library in C++, you can choose between dynamic and static libraries. Here we discuss the difference and when to use each one.

Firstly, we need to know what a library is. Basically, a library is a collection of functions. You may have noticed that we are using functions which are not defined in our code, or in that particular file. To have access to them, we include a header file, that contains declarations of those functions. After compile, there is a process called linking, that links those funcion declarations with their definitions, which are in another file. The result of this is an actual executeable.

## Static libraries

Static libraries are `.a` (or in Windows `.lib`) files. All the code relating to the library is in this file and it is directly linked into the program at compile time. A program using a static library **takes copies of the code that it uses from the static library and makes it part of the program**. Windows also has `.lib` files which are used to reference `.dll` files, but they act the same way as the first one.

## Dynamic libraries

Dynamic libraries are `.so` (or in Windows `.dll`, or in OS X `.dylib`) files. All the code relating to the library is in this file, and it is referenced by programs using it at run-time. A program using a dynamic library **only makes references to the code** that it uses in the dynamic library.

The memory address locations are resolved ultimately when the OS maps the dll into your process.A dll can be mapped into different processes at the same time and at different virtual addresses. The dll addresses are resolved when they are loaded, this happens during **runtime** when they're needed. They do have a module base address at compile time but its only a suggestion to the OS and since Vista with ASLR enabled it won't be used if your process gets randomized addresses.

Not all dlls are shared. For example, DirectX is located on every Windows PC and the dlls are shared and utilize between all applications using it. However all applications will ship their own dlls with their software and generally not share dlls with other applications. At one time, sharing a dll between many applications was generally considered a good thing. Reduced storage space and reduced RAM usage. But it can also lead to conflicts, where two applications require different versions of the dll, but because they have the same name it will cause issues. Putting them in the applications directory still allows things like plug-ins, so somebody can add functionality long after the base application has shipped.

Normally, some other non-Microsoft dlls you would install with your application and put them in your applications bin folder as part of the install process using an installer package. For example, if your application used Qt you would expect Qt dlls located in `my_application\bin`. This means that these dlls will not be shared among other applications even if they used the same version.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Now, the linking as I described above is static linking. This means that every executeable file contains in it every library (collection of functions) that it needs. This is potentially a waste of space, as there are many programs that may need the same functions. In this case, in memory there would be more copies of the same function. Dynamic linking prevents this, by linking at run-time, not at compile time. This means all the functions are in a special memory space and every program can access them, without have multiple copies of them. This reduces the amount of memory required.

### Static libraries

Static libraries increase the overall size of the binary, but it means that you don't need to carry along a copy of the library that is being used. As the code is connected at compile time there are not any additional run-time loading costs. The code is simply there.

### Dynamic libraries

Dynamic libraries reduce the amount of code that is duplicated in each program that makes use of the library, keeping the binaries small. It also allows you to replace the dynamic object with one that is functionally equivalent, but may have added performance benefits without needing to recompile the program that makes use of it. Dynamic libraries will, however have a small additional cost for the execution of the functions as well as a run-time loading cost as all the symbols in the library need to be connected to the things they use. Additionally, dynamic libraries can be loaded into an application at run-time, which is the general mechanism for implementing binary plug-in systems.


# .exp

A `.exp` file is an export file, which is used in Windows to define the symbols that are exported from a dynamic-link library (DLL). The `.exp file` contains a list of all the functions and variables that are part of the DLL's public interface, and it is used by the linker to generate the correct import library for the DLL.

A symbol is a named entity in a program or library that refers to a specific location in memory. In computer programming, symbols are used to represent various elements of a program, such as variables, functions, and objects.

In the context of dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) and export files (.exp), a symbol refers to a function or variable that is part of the public interface of the library. When a symbol is exported from a DLL, it means that the symbol is part of the library's public interface and can be accessed by client code that links against the library.

Therefore, functions that are inside the `.exp` could be made public via using `__declspec(dllexport)`.

# .pdb

A `.pdb` (Program Database) file is a file used by Microsoft Visual Studio and the Microsoft linker. It contains debugging information for an executable program or a dynamic-link library (DLL). The `.pdb` file provides information about the functions, variables, and data structures in the program, as well as information about the program's layout in memory. This information is used by the debugger to allow developers to debug their code.

The `.pdb` file contains symbols and debugging information about the program or library. When a program is compiled in debug mode, the compiler generates a `.pdb` file that contains information about the source code, including line numbers, variable names, and types, among other things. When a program is executed, the debugger uses the information in the `.pdb` file to provide an interactive debugging experience, including the ability to display source code and variables, set breakpoints, and examine the call stack.

It's worth noting that a `.pdb` file is not required to run a program, but it is required for debugging the program. When a program is built in release mode, the compiler typically does not generate a `.pdb` file, so the program cannot be debugged.
