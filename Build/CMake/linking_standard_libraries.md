# Do we need to link standard libraries?

When working with CMake we can use commands such as `target_include_directories()` to find header files. These header files are commonly generated by `configure_files()`. Now, without use of `target_include_directories()` we will receive a red undersore under the `#include example.h` because it is not found. However, this is not necessary for standard libraries such as the use of `#include <iostream>`.

This is happening because by default your **compiler is configured with the location of the standard library headers and will automatically link a library that supplies them**, typically called `libc` or something similar. This library also supplies system-specific behaviors like the startup code that gets called before your own `main` function.

[This behavior can be changed for specific effects](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Link-Options.html). Building with -nostdinc/-nostdinc++ will disable the automatic include paths. Linking with -nodefaultlibs will skip any automatic linking and only link what you've specified.
